# Eligibility Requirements

This section is for more **study-specific requirements**.

To begin with, if your study requires specific instructions, you are able to mention these here. For example, if you require participants to listen to audio in your study, you need to make sure that this is clear upfront (for instance, have access to headphones). This prevents students from registering for a study that they cannot complete because of software/hardware requirements.

Only students who fulfil the requirements will have access to the study.
