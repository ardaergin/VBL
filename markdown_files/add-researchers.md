# Adding Researchers to Your Study

Here you select your name as a researcher, and add your co-authors if there are any.

**Are you conducting your physical study yourself or with your own research assistants?**   

- Your research assistants need to be added as a researcher to your study, in order to manage the time slots and payment. For them to be added as a researcher to the study, they must have an account on VBL SONA. Hence, please ask your research assistant(s) to request an account by emailing us at [vbl@vu.nl](mailto:vbl@vu.nl) with their (1) first name, (2) last name, (3) VUnet ID, and (4) VU email address.

**Are you going to request lab assistants from VBL for your physical study?**   

- Then, you do not have to do anything. We will add the the appropriate research assistants to your study for them to manage the time slots and payment.
