# Attention Checks

Even though it is not mandatory, we strongly advise you to incorporate attention checks in your survey, as the process of [Granting or Denying Payment](granting-or-denying-payment) will be much easier for you if you do so.

We would like our researchers to make use of **at least one attention check per study**. If participants fail that attention check, please make sure these students will not receive any credits for this study. This is important to guarantee that students read instructions carefully. Make sure to reject with a message in Panl explaining that they failed the attention check(s).

Attention checks should be fair, and are the responsibility of the researcher. They should be easy to justify to colleagues and students, and decided about BEFORE the start of the study.
