# Granting or Denying Payment

Without having attention checks, you do not have grounds to deny participants payment. Hence, we strongly recommend you to incorporate attention checks to your surveys.

1. In SONA, locate and click on the 'My Studies'. This will take you to a list of all your posted experiments.
2. Among your studies, find the specific experiment for which you want to grant or deny credits and click on it. This action will display the experiment's details.
3. Under the experiment details, you will see a statement that says 'View/Administer Time slots'. Click on this statement. You will now see a display showing the current schedule and time slots for the experiment.
4. To grant or deny payment for a specific time slot, click on the 'Modify' button next to that time slot.
5. Here, within the 'Sign-Ups' section, you'll find a table listing the participants scheduled for that particular time slot.
    - To **grant payment** to a participant, click on the empty circle in the 'Payment Granted' column. Choose the right amount of credits.
    - To **reject payment** to a participant, because they failed to follow the study's instructions, click on the empty circle in the 'Payment Granted' column and choose "0". Add a comment that explains the choice. Attention! Students can see the comments. Possible comments:
        - "Student did not provide consent"
        - "Student withdrew from study participation"
        - "Student failed one or more attention checks"
    - Student did not attend the session?
        - For students who did not cancel participation in time but contacted you BEFORE the start of their session, choose **"Excused No-Show"** in the No-Show column.
        - For students who never contact you, or only AFTER the start of a session they did not participate in, select **'Unexcused No-Show'**.
6. Carefully check that no students are left with status "No action taken". You can check these in the tab **"Uncredited sign-ups"**
8. After making your selections for each participant, scroll down to the bottom of the table and make sure to click on the 'Update Sign-Ups' button to register the granted or denied credits into the system.
