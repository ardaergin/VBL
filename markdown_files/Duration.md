# Duration

Here you insert the time in minutes needed for the completion of the study by the participants. 

Please **round the time** of your study e.g., 8 min to 10 or 3 min to 5 min as the coordinators give research per 5 minutes of participation. 


>[!note]
>Keep in mind that physical sessions take longer than the duration of your study itself. Students need to wait in the waiting room, listen to instructions, take place, etc. This may easily add another ten minutes to each session, which should be reflected in the total duration you choose.

==After the pilot testing, can the duration be changed? -- Yes== (side note on "if you have any doubts about the duration")
- for pilot, seperate study than the main study

"significantly higher"
