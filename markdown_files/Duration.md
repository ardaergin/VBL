# Duration

Here you insert the **time (in minutes)** needed for the completion of the study.

**We strongly advise you to test the duration of your study**. You can do so with friends, family, and colleagues. If you have a physical lab study and you would like to test your study in the lab, please contact us regarding this and we will assist you.

After the end of your data collection, we will access your survey and check the average duration. If the average time in which participants have completed your study is significantly higher than your specified duration, we will ask you to increase the compensation for the participants to the actual average duration.
