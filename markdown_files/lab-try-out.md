# Conducting a Lab Try-out

If you have **a Physical Lab Study**, we strongly advise you to schedule a try-out before the study launch. This ensures that the study run smoothly in our physical lab location. This would be an informal try-out with some of our student-assistants being participants.

This is not exactly a pilot testing, but more of understanding whether the instructions given to participants, the procedure of the study, and the duration specified is reasonable. For instance, it might be possible that the instructions that you would like the participants to hear might take longer than expected, or there are some confusing aspects in the procedure that you have not realized.

In this try-out, you can be present to observe the process. For this, while [submitting your study for approval](submission-for-approval), please mention that you would like to be present. Then, we will be arranging a time where both you and the research assistants are available. It is also fine that we conduct this try-out for you, and let you know about our remarks in the aftermath.
