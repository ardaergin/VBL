# Adding Researchers to Your Study

Here you select your name as a researcher, and add your co-authors if there are any.

If you will be **conducting the study with your own research assistants** (see [here](arranging-lab-study-yourself) for more information on this), it is important that they are also added as a researcher, so that they can open and administer time slots when necessary. For them to be added as a researcher, they must have an account on VBL SONA. Hence, please ask your research assistant(s) to request an account by emailing us at [vbl@vu.nl](mailto:vbl@vu.nl) with your (1) first name, (2) last name, (3) VUnet ID, and (4) VU email address
