# Overview on Requesting a Study

Setting up your study in the SONA Pool is easier than you think! Just follow the steps below, and in case your study has special requirements, contact [vbl@vu.nl](mailto:vbl@vu.nl).

### Step 1: Study Creation
1) Log in to [VBL SONA](https://vu-vbl.sona-systems.com){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} using your **VUnetID**

### Step 2: After Creating Your Study

After creating your study, **contact us** for [Initial Study Verification](initial-study-verification) at [vbl@vu.nl](mailto:vbl@vu.nl).

After we have verified your study details and have given you a green light,	if you have **an Online Study**, you can simply [Submit your Study for Final Approval](submission-for-final-approval), and wait for us to launch your study!

On the other hand, if you have **a Physical Lab Study**:	
1) First, we would like you to [Schedule a Pilot Testing](schedule-a-pilot-testing) with us			
2) After a successful pilot testing, [Pick Available Dates](pick-available-dates) for the Lab		
3) After selecting the dates for the lab, you can [create time slots](arranging-time-slots) for participants in SONA.			


### Step 3: The Data Collection

1) We will handle the [study launch](study-launch), and students will be notified about your study		
2) [Your Responsibility During Data Collection](responsibility-during-data-collection) 	
3) [Granting or Denying Payment](granting-or-denying-payment)
