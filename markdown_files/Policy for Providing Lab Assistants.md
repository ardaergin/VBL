The marketing department has trained lab assistants to assist **faculty members of the marketing department** when collecting data in the physical lab. In order to plan your study well, make sure to contact the research administrators a month upfront. Time is needed to ensure that there are assistants available, that the study can be scheduled, and communicated to students. 

Does your study have specific instructions or requirements (e.g. virtual reality or products that need to be provided), contact the research administrators to connect you with a lab assistant.

**Are you a PhD. candidate?**
PhD. candidates are required to run their own studies in the SBE lab facilities and cannot ask for assistance of the lab assistants. Of course you are free to switch with fellow PhD. students to run specific time slots. We do strongly recommend that the division remains equal (e.g. you ask another PhD. student to run your lab study, please return the favor when the other PhD. student has a study in the lab). 

In case you yourself (e.g. research budget) or your supervisor is able to finance the assistance of lab assistants, an exemption could be provided by the research administration. 

**Are you from another department than marketing?**
We can share the manuals of the marketing lab assistants with you to facilitate you organizing your lab sessions.
