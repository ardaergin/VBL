# Duration

Here you insert the **time (in minutes)** needed for the completion of the study.

**We strongly advise you to test the duration of your study**. You can do so with friends, family, and colleagues. If you have a physical lab study and want to test your study in the lab, please contact us about this, and we will assist you.

After the end of your data collection, we will access your survey and check the average duration. We use the median for this calculation to avoid a skew by the participants that take an unusually long time. If the median time in which participants have completed your study is higher than your specified duration, we will ask you to increase the compensation for the participants to the actual median duration.
