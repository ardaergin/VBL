# Arranging access to the Transitorium building 

Our computer labs are located on the second basement floor of the Transitorium building. You need access cards to open the lab doors. We have arranged for the security team to provide access cards for researchers wanting to enter the lab spaces.

Please email the host/security of the Transitorium building that you will need an access card. 

- In this email, include your name, email address, phone number, experiment date and times, any instructions to the Host (like number of students, directing them to the waiting room on the first basement floor, etc). 
- Email [fa_fco-bev-tr@vu.nl](mailto:fa_fco-bev-tr@vu.nl) and [FA_FCO-BEV-HG@vu.nl](FA_FCO-BEV-HG@vu.nl), while including us ([vbl@vu.nl](mailto:vbl@vu.nl)) at cc. 

Please ensure that you **send this email to them prior to your experiment dates** with the above details. Without these details, the HOST will not be able to give you the access cards.
