>2. Among your studies, find the specific study for which you want to grant or deny payments and click on it. This action will display the study's details.
>3. Under the study details, you will see a statement that says **'View/Administer Time slots'**. Click on this statement. You will now see a display showing the current schedule and time slots for the study.
>3. To grant or deny payment for a specific time slot, click on the **'Modify'** button next to that time slot.
>4. Here, within the **'Sign-Ups' section**, you'll find a table listing the participants scheduled for that particular time slot.

>7. After making your selections for each participant, scroll down to the bottom of the table and make sure to click on the **'Update Sign-Ups'** button to register the granted or denied credits into the system.

Once the study is concluded, **you have two weeks** to make any changes to the list of participants that needs to be paid. By the end of these two weeks, if you have not made any changes, all the participants will be paid regardless of their status.

>[!info] <i class="fa-solid fa-info"></i> &nbsp Do you have an incentivized study? 
> For incentivized studies, you can also arrange the incentive payment through the payment page on SONA. 
>
> Example: 
> 
> - You have a performance task in your research and you incentivize participants.
> - After your study is concluded you identify the top 10 best performing participants. 
> - On the payment page on SONA (same page as described above), for each of these 10 participants, you should enter "Incentive: 15" as a comment. 
> - We will make the payment according to these comments, hence, please do not deviate from the format of "Incentive: `{amount}`".


## For Online Studies

For online studies, the granting of payment is automatic. Although, you still have actions to take.

First, sometimes participants sign up to participate but do not end up participating. In these cases, the "No Action Taken" box will be selected for these participants, and you should select "Excused" under "No-Show" instead. This is because a no-show does not cause issues for an online study and do not require a the consequence-bearing "Unexcused No-Show".

Secondly, you should investigate your data, and deny payment if necessary. Please see [this page](denying-payment) for the conditions under which you can deny payment and how to do so.

## For Physical Studies

For physical studies, your tasks depend on whether you have requested research assistants from us. 

**If you have requested research assistants from us**, they will carry out the granting payment and marking no-shows. Hence, your only task is to investigate your data, and deny payment if necessary. Please see [this page](denying-payment) for the conditions under which you can deny payment and how to do so.

**If you, or your own research assistants, have carried out your study**, you have to grant payment, mark the no-shows yourself. For a smoother process, these two should be carried out as the study is ongoing.

- To **grant payment** to a participant, click on the empty circle in the 'Payment Granted' column. The amount of payment to be granted by default should be visible, change it if necessary.
- For students who did not cancel participation in time but contacted you BEFORE the start of their session, choose **"Excused No-Show"** in the No-Show column.
- For students who never contact you, or only AFTER the start of a session they did not participate in, select **'Unexcused No-Show'**.

After the study has been completed, you can [deny payment](denying-payment) if necessary.
