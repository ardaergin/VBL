# Ethical Approval

Here, provide the reference number that you have received from the Ethical Review Board. Every research should have an ethical review code to be able to conduct a study at VBL.

If you are a researcher from the **School of Business and Economics** (SBE), ethical approval can be obtained either via the [online self-check](https://vueconomics.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_1SKjMzceWRZIk9D) or the [Ethics Review Board](https://vu.nl/en/about-vu/more-about/research-office) when needed.

Every faculty have their own review board. Please obtain a ethical review board approval (and the associated ethical review code) for your study from your respective faculty before starting to conduct a study at VBL. 

The only exception to this is the Law Faculty. **If you are a researcher from the Law Faculty**, please get in touch with us.


## IRB Approval Code

It is your own responsibility as a researcher to verify that your study complies with the ethical standard, by completing the [ethical checklist](https://vueconomics.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_1SKjMzceWRZIk9D). If the ethical checklist is not sufficient for your study, or you believe that your research should be approved by the **SBE Ethics Review Board (ERB)**, make sure to contact them and fill in the reference number. 

After you have completed the ethical checklist, you will receive a reference number formatted like `SBE3/29/2021djg590`. This is the code you will enter in SONA.

>[!warning]
>Even though we can give you an [[initial study verification]] and you can continue with some of the organizational steps, **we cannot make a study launch without an IRB approval code**.
