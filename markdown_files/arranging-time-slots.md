# Create, modify, or Schedule Time Slots

Go to “My Studies” in the menu at the top. You will see all studies (experiments); now click “Time slots” to the right of the study you want to give time slots. You will be shown a display of the current schedule/time slots. If you have not yet posted any times lots none will appear.

- To add one new time slot click the ‘Add A Time slot’ statement
- In the required fields, enter the date, start time, number of participants for that time slot, and location where participants are to meet the research assistant (experimenter). We advice to label the location as: "Waiting room Transitorium floor -1 / 11-cubicle lab" or "Waiting room Transitorium floor -1 / 15-cubicle lab". The first part is meant for students, to ensure they go to the correct location, which is the waiting room. The second part is needed to ensure labs are not double booked.
- To add several new time slots (e.g., because you are running multiple sessions) click the ‘Add Multiple Time slots’ statement. After, you enter the number of time slots to be added. You can add a slot of minutes to be added in between sessions
- For each time slot, enter the date, start time, number of participants, and the location in the required fields. Ensure that under the ‘Add This Time Slot?’ statement ‘Yes’ is highlighted for each time slot you want
added.
- Click on “Add Selected Time Slots” for the time slots to be activated

After selecting the number of seats and activating the time slots you would like to run, be careful that there is enough time (e.g. a study of 25 minutes can be planned as 30-minute sessions as you need to reset the surveys after each session. Make sure to schedule breaks between sessions, especially after the first or after two sessions it is wise to have a first break to fix any bugs or issues you encounter.

On the day of the experiment, pick up students from the waiting room and give them the instructions. Have people sign in to the session by mentioning their research ID.

 

Critical: You must be available all lab days, or make sure there is someone on your behalf.
