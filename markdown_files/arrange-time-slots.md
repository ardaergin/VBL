## How to create inital time slots on SONA

After receiving approval for your study and the available dates and times for the lab, the first step in your data collection process is to create time slots for participants to sign up.

Once you have added the time slots, please email us at [vbl@vu.nl](mailto:vbl@vu.nl), so that we can double check. Once we have given a check, we will activate your study, and it will be visible to the participants.

Follow the step-by-step process video below to open timeslots in SONA for participants.

>
>1. Go to **“My Studies”** in the menu at the top. You will see all studies (experiments). Now click **“Time slots”** to the right of the study you want to give time slots. 
>2. You will be shown a display of the current schedule/time slots. If you have not yet posted any timeslots, none will appear. To add one new time slot click the **"Add A Time slot"** statement.
>3. In the required fields, enter the date, start time, number of participants for that time slot, and location where participants are to meet the research assistant (experimenter). 
>    - We advice to label the location as: "Waiting room Transitorium floor -1 / 11-cubicle lab" or "Waiting room Transitorium floor -1 / 15-cubicle lab". The first part is meant for students, to ensure they go to the correct location, which is the waiting room. The second part is needed to ensure labs are not double booked.
>    - The number of participants depends on the lab capacity. For example: a 15-cubicle lab can accommodate 15 participants. 
>4. To add several new time slots (e.g., because you are running multiple sessions) click the **"Add Multiple Time slots"** statement. After, you enter the number of time slots to be added. You can add a slot of minutes to be added in between sessions.
>5. For each time slot, enter the date, start time, number of participants, and the location in the required fields. Ensure that under the "Add This Time Slot?" statement "Yes" is highlighted for each time slot you want to be added.
>6. Click on **“Add Selected Time Slots”** for the time slots to be activated


As a note, please make sure there is **adequate time in between the sessions** for you to reset the computers after each session, welcome participants, and for your breaks. To give you an idea, this might take about 5-10 minutes. 

- For example, if your first session is from 10:00 to 10:30, it would be wise to open the next session with 10:35 - 11:05.
- Please consider additional between-session times during the first day of your experiment. 

## How to cancel or modify timeslots later

To cancel or modify a timeslot later, navigate to the timeslots page, and click "modify" next to the timeslot you would like to modify. On this new page, you can click the "delete" button to delete a timeslot. If you want to modify the date and time, or the number of participants for the given session, you can also do so on this page. Once you are done, do not forget to click the "Update timeslot" button.
