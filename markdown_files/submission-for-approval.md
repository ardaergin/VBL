# Submitting Your Study for Approval

Once you have your study ready, you can submit your study for appoval. 

We strongly recommend testing your design before requesting for approval. We are happy provide access to the lab facilities to test your study.

1. In "My Studies," click "Inactive," select your study, and under "Study Information," click "Send Request."
2. On this new page, in the text box, include the **desired number of participants** and the **desired completion date**. For physical studies, please also provide whether you need our research assistants or will bring your own. 
    - PhD students must conduct their studies themselves. 
    - See the page for [arranging a lab study yourself](arranging-lab-study-yourself).
3. After this, if you have a physical study, and you are requesting lab assistants from us, please attach a Word/PDF document with the instructions necessary to be able to carry out your study. These instructions will be used by our lab assistants.
4. Once everything is complete, click the "**Send Request**" button.
