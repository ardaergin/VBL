# Select the Study Type

After selecting "Add New Study", you will have the option to pick from **two possible types of studies**:   

1. Standard Study   
2. Online External Study    

In a **"Standard Study"**, students will participate in **a single session** at our **physical lab location**, which is located on the second basement level (-2) of the [Transitorium Building](https://vu.nl/en/about-vu/more-about/transitorium){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

For more possibilities, see [types of studies](Types_of_Studies).
