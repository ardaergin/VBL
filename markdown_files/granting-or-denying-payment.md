>7. After making your selections for each participant, scroll down to the bottom of the table and make sure to click on the **'Update Sign-Ups'** button to register the granted or denied credits into the system.

Once the study is concluded, **you have two working days** to make any changes to the list of participants that need to be paid. By the end of these two days, if you have not made any changes, all the participants will be paid regardless of their status.

>[!info] <i class="fa-solid fa-info"></i> &nbsp Do you have an incentivized study? 
><br>
> For incentivized studies, you can also arrange the incentive payment through the payment page on SONA. 
>
> Example: 
> 
> - You have a performance task in your research and you incentivize participants by paying 15 EUR for the top 10 best performing participants.
> - After your study is concluded, you identify the top 10. 
> - On the payment page on SONA (same page as described above), for each of these 10 participants, you should enter "Incentive: 15" as a comment. 
> - We will make the payment according to these comments, hence, please do not deviate from the format of "Incentive: `{amount}`".


## For online studies

For online studies, participants are marked as "participated" automatically when they complete your study. Nevertheless, you still have actions to take.

First, sometimes participants sign up to participate but do not end up participating. 

- In these cases, you should select "Excused" under "No-Show" instead. The participant will not be denied payments. 

Secondly, you should investigate your data, and deny payment if necessary. Please see [this page](denying-payment) for the conditions under which you can deny payment and how to do so.

## For lab studies

For physical studies, your tasks depend on whether you have requested research assistants from us. 

If you have requested research assistants from us, they will mark participants as "participated" and “no-shows”. 

**If you have requested research assistants from us**, they will mark participants as "participated" or “no-show”. Hence, your only task is to investigate your data, and deny payment if necessary. Please see [this page](denying-payment) for the conditions under which you can deny payment and how to do so.

**If you, or your own research assistants, have carried out your study**, you must mark "participated" or "no-show" yourself. For a smoother process, these two should be carried out as the study is ongoing.

- To mark a participant as "participated", click on the empty circle in the 'Participated' column.
- For students who did not cancel participation in time but contacted you BEFORE the start of their session, choose **"Excused No-Show"** in the No-Show column.
- For students who never contact you, or only AFTER the start of the session they were supposed to participate in, select **'Unexcused No-Show'**.

After the study has been completed, you can [deny payment](denying-payment) if necessary.
