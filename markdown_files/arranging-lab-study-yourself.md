# Arranging a lab study yourself

>[!info] <i class="fa-solid fa-info"></i> &nbsp Are you a PhD. candidate?
>- PhD. candidates are required to run their own studies at VBL.
>- In case you yourself (e.g. research budget) or your supervisor is able to finance the assistance of lab assistants, we can provide an exemption. In such a case, please contact us at [vbl@vu.nl](mailto:vbl@vu.nl).Â   

## Arranging time slots

**If you are a PhD candidate** or you will have your **own research assistants** conducting your study, you need to arrange the time slots yourself.

After receiving approval for your study and the available dates and times for the lab, create time slots for participants to sign up. Learn more about creating and modifying time slots [here](arranging-time-slots).

Once you have added the time slots, please email us at [vbl@vu.nl](mailto:vbl@vu.nl), so that we can double check. Once we have given a check, we will activate your study, and it will be visible to the participants.

## Arranging access to the Transitorium building 

Our computer labs are located on the second basement floor of the Transitorium building. You need access cards to open the lab doors. We have arranged for the security team to provide access cards for researchers wanting to enter the lab spaces.

Please email the host/security of the Transitorium building that you will need an access card. 
- In this email, include your name, email address, phone number, experiment date and times, any instructions to the Host (like number of students, directing them to the waiting room on the first basement floor, etc). 
- Email [fa_fco-bev-tr@vu.nl](mailto:fa_fco-bev-tr@vu.nl) and [FA_FCO-BEV-HG@vu.nl](FA_FCO-BEV-HG@vu.nl), while including us ([vbl@vu.nl](mailto:vbl@vu.nl)) at cc. 

Please ensure that you **send this email to them prior to your experiment dates** with the above details. Without these details, the HOST will not be able to give you the access cards.
