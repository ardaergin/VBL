While we create your account, please ensure that the following points are completed in the meantime.       \n2. Have your ethical approval ready. If you do not know how to obtain an ethical or what the ethical approval should look like, check the [ethical approval](ethical-approval) page.         \n3. Have your budget number ready. We will ask for it during payment processing.\n4. Know your desired number of participants. You will need to communicate this information to us later in the process.\n5. We highly recommend incorporating [attention check(s)](attention-checks) in your survey. This will ensure that you can [deny payment](granting-or-denying-payment) for non-serious participation.       \n\n<br>\n\n### Step 1: Study creation\n\n1. Log in to [VBL SONA](https://vu-vbl.sona-systems.com){:target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"} using VU SSO (single sign-on).    \n2. Once in VBL SONA, [create a new study](create-a-new-study).  \n\n<br>\n\n### Step 2: Receiving approval for your study\n\n1. After creating your study, check out the page for [submitting your study for approval](submission-for-approval). \n2. Once you have submitted your study for approval, we will check your study details. If there is anything that needs to be changed about your study setup, we will contact you. \n3. Once you have received an approval:\n    - If you have **an online study**, you have no further actions to take for Step 2. We will launch your study.\n    - If you have **a physical lab study**, we will first communicate to you the availability of the lab and the expected completion date of your study via email. Then, we will arrange timeslots for your study in SONA and launch it. **If you are a PhD candidate** or you have your **own research assistants** conducting your study, the process is different. Please check out [this page](arranging-lab-study-yourself).\n\n<br>\n\n### Step 3: Data collection\n\nWhen we launch your study, all active students in the VBL pool will be notified.\n\n**During the Data Collection**: \n\n- For **online studies**, students can participate immediately, and you do not have a responsibility while data is being collected.\n- For **physical lab studies**, students will enroll in the available time slots and participate. If you are a PhD student (or you, or your own research assistants are carrying out the research), please take a look at [your responsibility during data collection](responsibility-during-data-collection).\n\n<br>\n\n### Step 4: Post data collection\n\n1. Once the study is concluded, you will be notified, and you will have two working days to carry out the process of [granting or denying payment](granting-or-denying-payment). \n2. In the meantime, we will check whether the average completion time of your study corresponds with your specified duration. If there is a discrepancy, this will be communicated to you, and you will be requested increase the payment amount.\n3. Once the two day period is over, we will relay the payment information to the financial department. They will contact you for approval. Please provide this approval as soon as possible.\n"

Pick up the participants from the waiting room (-1 Floor of the Transitorium building).\n    - Call their attention/opening: \"Are you here for the `[Time]` session of the `[Experiment Name]`? \n    - Then, bring them to the lab. \n2. After all the participants are downstairs, mark them as participated/unexcused.\n    - Read outloud the SONA IDs you have for the current timeslot, and ask students to identify themselves. \n    - Mark them as participated or unexcused. Please see the [granting or denying payment page](granting-or-denying-payment) to learn how to do that.\n3. Give instructions to all students.\n    - Standard Instructions: \"Thank you for your participation! Please leave your bags and phones outside. Hand your coats on the coat hangers available. This study will take about `[your study duration]` minutes, and it `[consists of a single study / several independent studies]`. Please read everything carefully and answer all the required questions. Please also prepare your research ID (a 4/5-digit number). When there is no way to continue to the next page, it\u2019s finished. Now you can enter a cubicle.\"\n\nCommonly asked questions by participants:\n\n- **\"Can I switch sessions?\"** or **\"I am late, can I participate in the next session?\"**: This type of request is usually not encouraged. However, if there are available timeslots in the next session and you feel comfortable to accommodate the request, you can do so. We recommend you to take a note of such situations for yourself for recordkeeping purposes.\n- **\"My computer crashed!\"**: If there is an available cubicle, take the participant there. If there are not enough computers due to emergent issues, take a note of the participant's ID, and let them go. The participant will receive payment for their participation regardless. Report the issue asap to VBL (vbl@vu.nl) and the Lab manager (s.desikan@vu.nl). \n\n### Ending your study sessions\nIt is important to note that you put the things in the lab as they were before. \n\n- Switch off all computers.\n- All keyboards, mouse, headphones and chairs should be placed as you found them. \n- Turn off the lights, close the door, and check if it is locked.\n- Return your access cards to the HOST of the Transitorium building.\n"

To give you an idea, this might take about 5-10 minutes. \n\n- For example, if your first session is from 10:00 to 10:30, it would be wise to open the next session with 10:35 - 11:05.\n- Please consider additional between-session times during the first day of your experiment. \n\nStep-by-step process to create, modify, or schedule time slots on SONA:\n\n1. Go to **\u201cMy Studies\u201d** in the menu at the top. You will see all studies (experiments). Now click **\u201cTime slots\u201d** to the right of the study you want to give time slots. \n2. You will be shown a display of the current schedule/time slots. If you have not yet posted any timeslots, none will appear. To add one new time slot click the **\"Add A Time slot\"** statement.\n3. In the required fields, enter the date, start time, number of participants for that time slot, and location where participants are to meet the research assistant (experimenter). \n    - We advice to label the location as: \"Waiting room Transitorium floor -1 / 11-cubicle lab\" or \"Waiting room Transitorium floor -1 / 15-cubicle lab\". The first part is meant for students, to ensure they go to the correct location, which is the waiting room. The second part is needed to ensure labs are not double booked.\n    - The number of participants depends on the lab capacity. For example: a 15-cubicle lab can accommodate 15 participants. \n4. To add several new time slots (e.g., because you are running multiple sessions) click the **\"Add Multiple Time slots\"** statement. After, you enter the number of time slots to be added. You can add a slot of minutes to be added in between sessions.\n5. For each time slot, enter the date, start time, number of participants, and the location in the required fields. Ensure that under the \"Add This Time Slot?\" statement \"Yes\" is highlighted for each time slot you want to be added.\n6. Click on **\u201cAdd Selected Time Slots\u201d** for the time slots to be activated\n"
