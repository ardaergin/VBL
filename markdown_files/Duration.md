# Duration

Here you insert the time in minutes needed for the completion of the study by the participants.

**We strongly advise you to test the duration of your study**. Either with friends, colleagues, or simply by doing a pilot study. 

If the average time in which participants have completed your study is significantly higher than your specified duration, we might ask you to increase the compensation for the participants to the actual average duration.

After the pilot testing, you can change the duration you have entered for your study if necessary.
