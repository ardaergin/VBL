>3. Under the study details, you will see a statement that says **'View/Administer Time slots'**. Click on this statement. You will now see a display showing the current schedule and time slots for the study.
>3. To grant or deny payment for a specific time slot, click on the **'Modify'** button next to that time slot.
>4. Here, within the **'Sign-Ups' section**, you'll find a table listing the participants scheduled for that particular time slot.
>5. Grant or deny payment based on the instructions below.
>6. Carefully check that no students are left with status "No action taken". You can check these in the tab **"Uncredited sign-ups"**
>7. After making your selections for each participant, scroll down to the bottom of the table and make sure to click on the **'Update Sign-Ups'** button to register the granted or denied credits into the system.

Once the study is concluded, **you have two weeks** to identify participants that you would like to reject the payment of. By the end of these two weeks, if you have not made any changes, all the participants will be paid regardless of their status.

## For Online Studies

For online studies, the granting of payment is automatic. Although, you still have actions to take.

First, sometimes participants sign up to participate but do not end up participating. In these cases, the "No Action Taken" box will be selected for these participants, and you should select "Excused" under "No-Show" instead. This is because a no-show does not cause issues for an online study and do not require a the consequence-bearing "Unexcused No-Show".

Secondly, you should investigate your data, and reject the payment for no-consent participants as well as participants with non-serious participation. Please see the [conditions under which you can reject payment](conditions-for-rejecting-payment). To **reject payment** to a participant, because of any of these conditions, click on the empty circle in the 'Payment Granted' column and choose "0". Add a comment that explains the choice, which the students will see (e.g., "failed attention check"). The SONA IDs of these participants should also be communicated to [vbl@vu.nl](mailto:vbl@vu.nl), so that they can be issued a warning.


## For Physical Studies

For physical studies, your tasks depend on whether you have requested research assistants from us. 

**If you have requested research assistants from us**, they will carry out the granting payment and marking no-shows. Hence, your only task is to investigate your data, and reject the payment for no-consent participants as well as participants with non-serious participation. Please see the [conditions under which you can reject payment](conditions-for-rejecting-payment) for more information on this. To **reject payment** to a participant, because of any of these conditions, click on the empty circle in the 'Payment Granted' column and choose "0". The SONA IDs of these participants should also be communicated to [vbl@vu.nl](mailto:vbl@vu.nl), so that they can be issued a warning.

**If you, or your own research assistants, have carried out your study**, you have to grant payment and mark the no-shows yourself.

- To **grant payment** to a participant, click on the empty circle in the 'Payment Granted' column. The amount of payment to be granted by default should be visible, change it if necessary.
- For students who did not cancel participation in time but contacted you BEFORE the start of their session, choose **"Excused No-Show"** in the No-Show column.
- For students who never contact you, or only AFTER the start of a session they did not participate in, select **'Unexcused No-Show'**.
