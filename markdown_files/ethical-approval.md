# Ethical Approval

Every research should have an ethical review code to be able to conduct a study at VBL.

If you are a researcher from the **School of Business and Economics** (SBE), ethical approval can be obtained either via the [online self-check](https://vueconomics.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_1SKjMzceWRZIk9D) or the [Ethics Review Board](https://vu.nl/en/about-vu/more-about/research-office) when needed.

Every faculty have their own review board. Please obtain a ethical review board approval (and the associated ethical review code) for your study from your respective faculty before starting to conduct a study at VBL. 

The only exception to this is the Law Faculty. **If you are a researcher from the Law Faculty**, please get in touch with us.
