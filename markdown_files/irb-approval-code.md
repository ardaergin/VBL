Here, provide the reference number that you have received from the Ethical Review Board. 

It is your own responsibility as a researcher to verify that your study complies with the ethical standard, by completing theÂ [ethical checklist](https://vueconomics.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_1SKjMzceWRZIk9D). If the ethical checklist is not sufficient for your study, or you believe that your research should be approved by the **SBE Ethics Review Board (ERB)**, make sure to contact them and fill in the reference number. 

After you have completed the ethical checklist, you will receive a reference number formatted like `SBE3/29/2021djg590`. This is the code you will enter in SONA.

>[!warning]
>Even though we can give you an [[initial study verification]] and you can continue with some of the organizational steps, **we cannot make a [[study launch]] without an IRB approval code**.
