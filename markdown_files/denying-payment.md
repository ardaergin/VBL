# Denying payment

You should investigate your data and deny the payment when necessary.

### Conditions under which you can deny payment
- The participant **did not give consent**, and, therefore, did not participate in the study.
- The participant **did not finish** the study. You cannot deny payment if the participant skipped questions but finalized the study.
- The participant failed an **attention check**.
- The participant completed the task at an **unusually rapid pace**, identified as being more than 3 standard deviations faster than the average.
- The participant **clearly did not show effort** for the study, even though you have *explicitly specified* the amount of effort you are expecting. For example, when explicitly asked to write a paragraph, they only wrote a couple of words, or for the entire survey, they chose the same point on a Likert scale.

### How to deny payment
To deny payment to a participant, because of any of these conditions, keep their status as "participated", but add a comment "Payment denied: `{...}`" with filling in the `{...}` field with the appropriate reasoning (e.g., "failed attention check"). This comment will be visible to the students. Please do not deviate from the wording "Payment denied" at the beginning of the comment. You HAVE TO add such comments if you would like to deny payment.
