Click on \u201cAdd Selected Time Slots\u201d for the time slots to be activated\n7. After selecting the number of seats and activating the time slots you would like to run, be careful that there is enough time e.g. a study of 25 minutes can be planned as 30-minute sessions as the surveys needs to be resetted after each session. Make sure to schedule breaks between sessions, especially after the first or after two sessions it is wise to have a first break to fix any bugs or issues you encounter.\n"
