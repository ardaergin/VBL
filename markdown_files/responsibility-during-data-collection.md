# Your Responsibility During Data Collection

As soon as the requested details have been approved by the research coordination, the study will be visible to students. 

For **online studies**, students can simply enroll and participate immediately, and you do not have a responsibility during this process.

For **physical lab studies**, students will enroll to the upcoming time slots. 

- On the day of your studies, once you or the lab assistants are in the lab, make sure to check each student using the dashboard section of your study. 
- Ask each student for their SONA ID before entering the lab and confirm whether the time slot matches the current time and date. If correct, click the plus sign to check the student into the lab.
- **Critical:**Â Do not forget to check students in, no check-in means that the student cannot receive credits. After the student is checked in, their participation is automatically approved. In cases of failed attention checks or unusual behaviour, you are able to withdraw your research credits in the system.
