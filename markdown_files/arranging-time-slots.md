# Create, modify, or Schedule Time Slots on SONA

Please follow the step-by-step process below to open timeslots in SONA for participants. 

As a note, please make sure there is adequate time in between the sessions. You, or your research assistants, will need to reset the computers after each session and welcome participants. And this might take about 5 minutes. Hence, if you have opened a session at 10:00 - 10:30, it would be wise to open the next session with 10:35 - 11:05.

We advise to make this between-session duration longer for the first sessions you are conducting, since it might take longer when you or your research assistants are first getting used to it.

1. Go to **“My Studies”** in the menu at the top. You will see all studies (experiments). Now click **“Time slots”** to the right of the study you want to give time slots. 
2. You will be shown a display of the current schedule/time slots. If you have not yet posted any timeslots, none will appear. To add one new time slot click the **"Add A Time slot"** statement.
3. In the required fields, enter the date, start time, number of participants for that time slot, and location where participants are to meet the research assistant (experimenter). We advice to label the location as: "Waiting room Transitorium floor -1 / 11-cubicle lab" or "Waiting room Transitorium floor -1 / 15-cubicle lab". The first part is meant for students, to ensure they go to the correct location, which is the waiting room. The second part is needed to ensure labs are not double booked.
4. To add several new time slots (e.g., because you are running multiple sessions) click the **"Add Multiple Time slots"** statement. After, you enter the number of time slots to be added. You can add a slot of minutes to be added in between sessions.
5. For each time slot, enter the date, start time, number of participants, and the location in the required fields. Ensure that under the "Add This Time Slot?" statement "Yes" is highlighted for each time slot you want to be added.
6. Click on **“Add Selected Time Slots”** for the time slots to be activated
