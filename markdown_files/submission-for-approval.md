# Submitting your study for approval

Once you have your study ready, you can submit your study for appoval. 

We strongly recommend testing your design before requesting for approval. We are happy provide access to the lab facilities to test your study.

1. In "My Studies," click "Inactive," select your study, and under "Study Information," click "Send Request."
2. On this new page, in the text box, include your **desired number of participants**, **desired completion date**, and **budget number**. For physical studies, please also provide whether you need our research assistants or will bring your own (note that PhD students must conduct their studies themselves; see the page for [arranging a lab study yourself](arranging-lab-study-yourself)). See below for an example entry to this text box. 
3. After this, if you have a physical study, and you are requesting lab assistants from us, please attach a Word/PDF document with the instructions necessary to carry out your study. These instructions will be used by our lab assistants.
4. Once everything is complete, click the "**Send Request**" button.
5. Finally, we also would like you to share your survey with us. If you are using Qualtrics, please add [vbl@vu.nl](mailto:vbl@vu.nl) to the collaborators of the study under "add the people you want to colaborate with". If you are using any other survey software, please mention this in the form on this page.
