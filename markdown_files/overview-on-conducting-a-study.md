# Overview on Conducting a Study through VBL

Setting up your study in the SONA Pool is easier than you think! Just follow the steps below, and in case the information you are looking for is not available, please do not hesitate to contact us at [vbl@vu.nl](mailto:vbl@vu.nl).

<br>

### Step 0: Checks Before Starting the Process

1. Request a researcher account by emailing us at [vbl@vu.nl](mailto:vbl@vu.nl) with your (1) first name, (2) last name, (3) VUnet ID, and (4) VU email address. While we create your account, please ensure that the following points are completed in the meantime.       
2. Make sure you have your ethical approval ready. If you do not know how to obtain an ethical or what the ethical approval should look like, check the [ethical approval](ethical-approval) page.         
3. Know your [desired number of participants](desired-number-of-participants). While asking for approval for your study, you will need to communicate this information to us.
4. Incorporate [attention check(s)](attention-checks) in your survey. This will ensure that you can [deny payment](granting-or-denying-payment) for non-serious participation.       
5. Are you planning to only allow participation based on a certain criteria? VBL currently does not have a collection of prescreeners, hence, you can set this up within your own study.

### Step 1: Study Creation

1. Log in to [VBL SONA](https://vu-vbl.sona-systems.com){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} using your **VUnetID** and the password we have emailed to you.		
2. [Create a New Study](create-a-new-study):		
    - [Select the Study Type](select-the-study-type)		
    - [Fill in the Study Information](fill-in-the-study-information)

### Step 2: Receiving Approval for Your Study

After creating your study, you can submit your study [Submit your Study for Approval](submission-for-approval). Although, before doing so, please have a look at this [Study Verification](study-verification) page for which details we will check, so you can have them in place.

Once we receive your approval request, we will carry out the [study verification](study-verification) process. If there is anything that needs to be changed about your study setup, we will email you. If this happens, when you incorporate the changes we requested, please email us, so that we can carry out the verification procedure again. Once your study is verified: 

If you have **an Online Study**, you have no further actions to take for this step. We will approve and launch your study!

If you have **a Physical Lab Study**:

1. We will first communicate you the availability in the lab and the expected completion date of your study via email. Once you approve this arrangement (via replying to our email),
2. If you have requested a [lab try-out](lab-try-out), this will be arranged and carried out first.
3. Then, we will approve your study, arrange timeslots for it on SONA, and launch it.

- **If you are a PhD student** or you will have your **own research assistants** conducting your study, the third step above is different. Please check out [this page](arranging-lab-study-yourself).

### Step 3: The Data Collection

When we launch your study, the students in the VBL pool will be notified.

**During the Data Collection**: 

- For **online studies**, students can simply enroll and participate immediately, and you do not have a responsibility while data is being collected.
- For **physical lab studies**, students will enroll to the upcoming time slots. If you are a PhD student (or you, or your own research assistants are carrying out the research), please take a look at [your responsibility during data collection](responsibility-during-data-collection).

**Paying the Participants**:

Once the study is concluded, you have two weeks to carry out the process of [Granting or Denying Payment](granting-or-denying-payment).
