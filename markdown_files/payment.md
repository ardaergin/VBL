# Payment

The payment for the studies is calculated based on:

- 10€ per hour for physical lab studies.
- 7.5€ per hour for online studies. 

You can use the tool below to calculate the amount you have to pay each participant based on the [duration](/step-1/duration) of your study (in minutes).

Studies that require more engagement from the participant (e.g., EEG studies) can offer higher payment for participants. Please reach out to us if this is applicable for your study.
