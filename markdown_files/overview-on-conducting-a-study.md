# Conduct a study as a researcher

Setting up your study in the VBL student pool is easier than you think! Just follow the steps below.

<br>

### Step 0: Checks before starting the process

1. Request a researcher account by emailing us at [vbl@vu.nl](mailto:vbl@vu.nl) with your (1) first name, (2) last name, (3) VUnet ID, and (4) VU email address. While we create your account, please ensure that the following points are completed in the meantime.       
2. Make sure you have your ethical approval ready. If you do not know how to obtain an ethical or what the ethical approval should look like, check the [ethical approval](ethical-approval) page.         
3. Make sure you have your budget number ready. This is necessary for the financial department to process the payments to the participants. 
4. Know your desired number of participants. You will need to communicate this information to us later in the process.
5. We highly recommend incorporating [attention check(s)](attention-checks) in your survey. This will ensure that you can [deny payment](granting-or-denying-payment) for non-serious participation.

### Step 1: Study creation

1. Log in to [VBL SONA](https://vu-vbl.sona-systems.com){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} using your **VUnetID** and the password we have emailed to you.    
2. Once in VBL SONA, [create a new study](create-a-new-study).

### Step 2: Receiving approval for your study

1. After creating your study, check out the page for [submitting your study for approval](submission-for-approval). 
2. Once you have submitted your study for approval, we will check your study details. If there is anything that needs to be changed about your study setup, we will email you. 
3. Once you have received an approval:
    - If you have **an online study**, you have no further actions to take for Step 2. We will launch your study.
    - If you have **a physical lab study**, we will first communicate you the availability of the lab and the expected completion date of your study via email. Then, we will arrange timeslots for your study in SONA and launch it. **If you are a PhD candidate** or you will have your **own research assistants** conducting your study, the process is different. Please check out [this page](arranging-lab-study-yourself).

<br>

### Step 3: Data collection

When we launch your study, the students in the VBL pool will be notified.

**During the Data Collection**: 

- For **online studies**, students can simply enroll and participate immediately, and you do not have a responsibility while data is being collected.
- For **physical lab studies**, students will enroll to the upcoming time slots. If you are a PhD student (or you, or your own research assistants are carrying out the research), please take a look at [your responsibility during data collection](responsibility-during-data-collection).

<br>

### Step 4: Post data collection

**Checks**:

- Please share with us your budget number and a collaboration code for your survey (e.g., for Qualtrics) in order for us to check the average duration in your study. 
- Share with us a file (any format) with two columns: SONA ID and duration


**Paying the Participants**:

Once the study is concluded, you have five days to carry out the process of [granting or denying payment](granting-or-denying-payment). 

Once this period is over, we will relay the payment information to the financial department. They will contact you for approval. Please provide this approval as soon as possible.
