# Ethical approval

All studies at VBL require an ethical approval. When you are filling in your study information on SONA, you will need to provide the Ethical Review Board (ERB) approval code for your study. Please contact your faculty's ethical approval board for getting this code.


<u>If you belong to the **faculty FGB**:</u>
You have an ethics commitee, that can be contacted to obtain ethical approval for your studies. For more information, please send an email to [vcwe.fgb@vu.nl](mailto:vcwe.fgb@vu.nl).


<u>If you belong to the **faculty SBE**:</u>
You can start the ethical approval procedure by filling in the [online ethics self-check](https://vueconomics.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_1SKjMzceWRZIk9D){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}. 
If your research does not require a Ethics Review Board approval, you will automatically receive a ethical review code (e.g., `SBE3/29/2021djg590`).
If the online ethics self-check requests that your research needs additional approval, you will be asked to download a copy of your ethics application so that you can send it to the Ethics Review Board for further evaluation. For more information regarding this, see <u>**[this page](https://vu.nl/en/about-vu/faculties/school-of-business-and-economics/more-about/sbe-research-ethics-and-integrity){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}**</u>.
