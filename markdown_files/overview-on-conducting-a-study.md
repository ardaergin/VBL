# Conduct a study as a researcher

Setting up your study in the VBL student pool is easier than you think! First, request a researcher account by emailing us at [vbl@vu.nl](mailto:vbl@vu.nl) with your (1) first name, (2) last name, (3) VUnet ID, and (4) VU email address. Once we create an account for you, just follow the steps below.

<br>

### Step 1: Study creation

1. Log in to [VBL SONA](https://vu-vbl.sona-systems.com){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} using VU SSO (single sign-on).    
2. Once in VBL SONA, [create a new study](create-a-new-study).

### Step 2: Receiving approval for your study

1. After creating your study, check out the page for [submitting your study for approval](submission-for-approval). 
2. Once you have submitted your study for approval, we will check your study details. If there is anything that needs to be changed about your study setup, we will contact you. 
3. Once you have received an approval:
    - If you have **an online study**, you have no further actions to take for Step 2. We will launch your study.
    - If you have **a physical lab study**, we will first communicate to you the availability of the lab and the expected completion date of your study via email. Then, we will arrange timeslots for your study in SONA and launch it. **If you are a PhD candidate** or you have your **own research assistants** conducting your study, the process is different. Please check out [this page](arranging-lab-study-yourself).

<br>

### Step 3: Data collection

When we launch your study, all active students in the VBL pool will be notified.

**During the Data Collection**: 

- For **online studies**, students can participate immediately, and you do not have a responsibility while data is being collected.
- For **physical lab studies**, students will enroll in the available time slots and participate. If you are a PhD student (or you, or your own research assistants are carrying out the research), please take a look at [your responsibility during data collection](responsibility-during-data-collection).

<br>

### Step 4: Post data collection

1. Once the study is concluded, you will be notified, and you will have two working days to carry out the process of [granting or denying payment](granting-or-denying-payment). 
2. In the meantime, we will check whether the average completion time of your study corresponds with your specified duration. If there is a discrepancy, this will be communicated to you, and you will be requested increase the payment amount.
3. Once the two day period is over, we will relay the payment information to the financial department. They will contact you for approval. Please provide this approval as soon as possible.
