# Pre-requisites and disqualifiers
You can use this section if you want to screen for participants who have previously participated in another study conducted via our participant pool.

- For example, you can disqualify participants based on a previous study they have participated in.
- Or, by the same token, you can set a pre-requisite that the participant must have participated in a previous study.
