Even though it is not mandatory, we strongly advise you to incorporate attention checks in your survey, as the process of [[Granting or Denying Payment]] will be much easier for you if you do so.

>[!example]- Example: Attention Check Item
>"This is an attention check item, please select 'four' as your response."

---

We would like our researchers to make use of **at least one attention check per study**. If participants fail that attention check, please make sure these students will not receive any credits for this study. This is important to guarantee that students read instructions carefully. Make sure to reject with a message in Panl explaining that they failed the attention check(s).

Attention checks should be fair, and are the responsibility of the researcher. They should be easy to justify to colleagues and students, and decided about BEFORE the start of the study.

**At the beginning of your study:** 
At the beginning of your study, please use the following standard form in order to inform students that they have to pay attention, and add the multiple choice option below:

```
ATTENTION! For the quality of the data, it is very important that participation in the session is done with care. Therefore, there will be some attention checks in the survey. If you fail to answer these questions correctly, the credits of this session will be deducted in your account (within two weeks after participation). Click the box below to indicate you have read and understood this remark, and agree with the conditions.
```

==nobody will do this extra question, just informing should be fine I think==

You can ask participants to select a specific response such as 'somewhat agree' or a number of a scale (see last item of the scale below)

In a study about breast reconstruction, we asked participants:

In this survey you were asked to think about a certain cosmetic surgery. Which kind of surgery was it?"

- Abdomen
- Breast
- Face
- Skin
- Don't remember--> Participants who did not answer "Breast" were rejected
