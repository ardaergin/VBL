# Arranging a Physical Lab Study Yourself

>[!info] <i class="fa-solid fa-info"></i> &nbsp Are you a PhD. candidate?
>- PhD. candidates are required to run their own studies at VBL and cannot ask for assistance of the lab assistants.    
>- In case you yourself (e.g. research budget) or your supervisor is able to finance the assistance of lab assistants, we can provide an exemption. In such a case, please contact us at [vbl@vu.nl](mailto:vbl@vu.nl).Â   

**If you are a PhD candidate** or you will have your **own research assistants** conducting your study, you need to arrange the time slots yourself.

After receiving approval for your study and the available dates and times for the lab, create time slots for participants to sign up. Learn more about creating and modifying time slots [here](arranging-time-slots).

Once you have added the time slots, please email us at [vbl@vu.nl](mailto:vbl@vu.nl), so that we can double check. Once we have given a check, we will activate your study, and it will be visible to the participants.
