# Overview on Conducting a Study through VBL

Setting up your study in the SONA Pool is easier than you think! Just follow the steps below, and in case your study has special requirements, contact [vbl@vu.nl](mailto:vbl@vu.nl).

### Step 0: Checks Before Starting the Process

For a smoother process:

1. Make sure you have your [ethical approval](ethical-approval).        
2. Know your [desired number of participants](desired-number-of-participants).      
3. Incorporate [attention check(s)](attention-checks) in your survey. This will ensure that you can [deny payment](granting-or-denying-payment) for non-serious participation.       
4. If you would like to have any prescreeners for your study, check out how to do it [here](prescreeners).

### Step 2: After Creating Your Study

(*divide this part into two seperate pages possibly*?)

After creating your study, **contact us** for [Initial Study Verification](initial-study-verification) at [vbl@vu.nl](mailto:vbl@vu.nl).

After we have verified your study details and have given you a green light,	if you have **an Online Study**, you can simply [Submit your Study for Final Approval](submission-for-final-approval), and wait for us to launch your study!

On the other hand, if you have **a Physical Lab Study**:	

1. First, we would like you to [Schedule a Pilot Testing](schedule-a-pilot-testing) with us			
2. After a successful pilot testing, [Pick Available Dates](pick-available-dates) for the Lab		
3. After selecting the dates for the lab, you can [create time slots](arranging-time-slots) for participants in SONA.

### Step 3: The Data Collection

1. We will handle the [study launch](study-launch), and students will be notified about your study		
2. [Your Responsibility During Data Collection](responsibility-during-data-collection) 	
3. [Granting or Denying Payment](granting-or-denying-payment)
