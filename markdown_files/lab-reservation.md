# Reserving the Lab

For physical studies, based on the availability of the lab and the research assistants, you can select dates that you would like your study to be conducted. Based on the lab reservation you have made in the system, you can then [open timeslots for your study](arranging-time-slots) in SONA.

Before you make a reservation, make sure to check out our [policy regarding providing lab assistants](providing-lab-assistants).
