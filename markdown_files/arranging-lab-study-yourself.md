## Our Policy Regarding Providing Lab Assistants

VBL has limited number of trained assistants to assist **faculty members of the marketing department** when collecting data in the physical lab. In order to plan your study well, make sure to contact us a month upfront. Time is needed to ensure that there are assistants available, that the study can be scheduled, and communicated to students. 

Does your study have specific instructions or requirements? Contact us to connect you with a lab assistant.

**Are you a PhD. candidate?**

- PhD. candidates are required to run their own studies at VBL and cannot ask for assistance of the lab assistants. 
- In case you yourself (e.g. research budget) or your supervisor is able to finance the assistance of lab assistants, an exemption could be provided by the research administration. 

**Are you from another department than marketing?**

- We can share the manuals of the marketing lab assistants with you to facilitate you organizing your lab sessions.
