# Eligibility Requirements

This section is for you to specify your **study-specific requirements**. 

For example, "you can only participate in this research if you are male". For further guarantee, also include a corresponding check in your research.

For example, for eye-tracking studies, you would need to specify that people with glasses cannot participate and you have to specify this in this section.
