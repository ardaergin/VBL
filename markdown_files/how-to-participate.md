As a participant of VBL, you get to contribute to the research at VU and earn money for your participation.

### Getting started

Log in to [VBL SONA](https://vu-vbl.sona-systems.com){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} using VU SSO (Single Sign-on), and participate in the available studies! 

When you are logging in to VBL SONA for the first time, you will be asked some questions where you need to fill in your name, email, address, and IBAN (for payment). This data is essential to financially compensate you for your research participation, is collected per VU privacy policy, and will only be viewed by the financial administration to pay you.

If any of these details change (e.g., bank account, home address, email address, ...), it is your responsibility to inform us about the change by emailing us at [vbl@vu.nl](mailto:vbl@vu.nl).

### Paid research participation

You will receive a notification via email when a study is available for you to participate in. You can participate in online or physical lab studies.

- You can immediately participate in an available online study.
- For a physical lab study, you will need  to choose your timeslot from the available timeslots

The compensation rate is **12.5 EUR per hour** if you participate in a on-site lab study and **10 EUR per hour** if you participate in an online study. This rate can be higher for studies with a performance incentive. After participating, payment will usually take 2-3 weeks.

For physical studies, you are allowed to cancel your participation from the research up to 24 hours prior to your scheduled time. If circumstances prevent you from attending after this period, please notify the researchers by email. **Accumulating three unexcused absences will result in a suspension of your account for three months**.
