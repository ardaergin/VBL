# Adding Researchers to Your Study

Here you select your name as a researcher.

==You can also add colleagues from VU.== ==It is important that the research assistants are added to the study so that they can open and administer time slots.==


**These feel obsolete**: 
- Also, you can add all co-authors if they are in SONA. 
- If you like us to add your coauthors to Sona, please send us their first name, last name, email address and Vunet ID (or preferred user name if they do not have a Vunet ID).  

you will not be able to add authors outside.
