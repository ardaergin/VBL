# Submitting Your Study for Approval

Once you have your study ready, you can submit your study for appoval. 

Before doing so, please take a look at this [Study Verification](study-verification) page for which details we will check, so you can have them in place.  

We additionally strongly recommend testing your design before requesting for approval. For online studies, you can test with friends, family, colleagues, we can also ask our research assistants to test your design if you request this (please add this request to Step 2 below). For physical lab studies, we can arrange a [lab try-out](lab-try-out) for you (also see below, as well as the associated linked page).

1. Go to "My Studies" on the top navigaton bar, click "Inactive", and select the study you want to send for approval. In the study page, under "Study Information", you will see "Study Status" as "Not Approved", click "**Send Request**" underneath.
2. Here, in the text box that appears on this new page, we would like you to include your **Desired Number of Participants** (e.g., "100"), and **Desired Date of Completion** (e.g., "asap", or "September 2024"). **If you have a physical study**, we request two additional pieces of information:
    - Whether you are requesting research assistants or you will be bringing your own research assistants. **If you are a PhD student** doing a physical lab study, you have to conduct the study yourself, please check out [this page](arranging-lab-study-yourself).
    - Whether you would like to conduct a '[lab try-out](lab-try-out)' (which we recommend if you have not tested your design before), and whether you would like to be present in this try-out.
3. After this, if you have a physical study, and you are requesting lab assistants from us, please attach a Word/PDF document with the instructions necessary to be able to carry out your study. These instructions will be used by our lab assistants.
4. Once everything is complete, click the "**Send Request**" button.
