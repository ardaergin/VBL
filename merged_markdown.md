# Duration

Here you insert the time in minutes needed for the completion of the study by the participants. 

Please **round the time** of your study e.g., 8 min to 10 or 3 min to 5 min as the coordinators give research per 5 minutes of participation. 

Keep in mind that physical sessions take longer than the duration of your study itself. Students need to wait in the waiting room, listen to instructions, take place, etc. This may easily add another ten minutes to each session, which should be reflected in the total duration you choose.

==After the pilot testing, can the duration be changed? -- Yes== (side note on "if you have any doubts about the duration")
- for pilot, seperate study than the main study

"significantly higher"


For this section, enter any preparation a student must do **before the actual study** participation.

>[!example] Examples for Preparation Requests
>- **Example**: "Please bring a personal object to the lab that has a sentimental value for you."
>- **Example**: "Please read this newspaper article before the study."

If your study have no preparation requirements, you can simply enter **"No preparation needed"**.



# Adding Researchers to Your Study

Here you select your name as a researcher.

==You can also add colleagues from VU.== ==It is important that the research assistants are added to the study so that they can open and administer time slots.==


**These feel obsolete**: 
- Also, you can add all co-authors if they are in SONA. 
- If you like us to add your coauthors to Sona, please send us their first name, last name, email address and Vunet ID (or preferred user name if they do not have a Vunet ID).  

you will not be able to add authors outside.
==making a statement about authors outside VU==


# Create, modify, or Schedule Time Slots

Go to “My Studies” in the menu at the top. You will see all studies (experiments); now click “Time slots” to the right of the study you want to give time slots. You will be shown a display of the current schedule/time slots. If you have not yet posted any times lots none will appear.

- To add one new time slot click the ‘Add A Time slot’ statement
- In the required fields, enter the date, start time, number of participants for that time slot, and location where participants are to meet the research assistant (experimenter). We advice to label the location as: "Waiting room Transitorium floor -1 / 11-cubicle lab" or "Waiting room Transitorium floor -1 / 15-cubicle lab". The first part is meant for students, to ensure they go to the correct location, which is the waiting room. The second part is needed to ensure labs are not double booked.
- To add several new time slots (e.g., because you are running multiple sessions) click the ‘Add Multiple Time slots’ statement. After, you enter the number of time slots to be added. You can add a slot of minutes to be added in between sessions
- For each time slot, enter the date, start time, number of participants, and the location in the required fields. Ensure that under the ‘Add This Time Slot?’ statement ‘Yes’ is highlighted for each time slot you want
added.
- Click on “Add Selected Time Slots” for the time slots to be activated

After selecting the number of seats and activating the time slots you would like to run, be careful that there is enough time (e.g. a study of 25 minutes can be planned as 30-minute sessions as you need to reset the surveys after each session. Make sure to schedule breaks between sessions, especially after the first or after two sessions it is wise to have a first break to fix any bugs or issues you encounter.

On the day of the experiment, pick up students from the waiting room and give them the instructions. Have people sign in to the session by mentioning their research ID.

 

Critical: You must be available all lab days, or make sure there is someone on your behalf.



# Attention Checks

Even though it is not mandatory, we strongly advise you to incorporate attention checks in your survey, as the process of [[Granting or Denying Payment]] will be much easier for you if you do so.

>[!example] Example: Attention Check Item
>"This is an attention check item, please select 'four' as your response."

---

We would like our researchers to make use of **at least one attention check per study**. If participants fail that attention check, please make sure these students will not receive any credits for this study. This is important to guarantee that students read instructions carefully. Make sure to reject with a message in Panl explaining that they failed the attention check(s).

Attention checks should be fair, and are the responsibility of the researcher. They should be easy to justify to colleagues and students, and decided about BEFORE the start of the study.

**At the beginning of your study:** 
At the beginning of your study, please use the following standard form in order to inform students that they have to pay attention, and add the multiple choice option below:

```
ATTENTION! For the quality of the data, it is very important that participation in the session is done with care. Therefore, there will be some attention checks in the survey. If you fail to answer these questions correctly, the credits of this session will be deducted in your account (within two weeks after participation). Click the box below to indicate you have read and understood this remark, and agree with the conditions.
```

==nobody will do this extra question, just informing should be fine I think==

>[!example] Example: Attention Check in a Multiple Choice Matrix
>![[Screenshot 2021-10-28 at 09.41.41.png]]

You can ask participants to select a specific response such as 'somewhat agree' or a number of a scale (see last item of the scale below)

In a study about breast reconstruction, we asked participants:

In this survey you were asked to think about a certain cosmetic surgery. Which kind of surgery was it?"

- Abdomen
- Breast
- Face
- Skin
- Don't remember--> Participants who did not answer "Breast" were rejected





# Brief Abstract

Here, explain your study in **a single line** to give students a general idea about what they should expect if they participate in your study (e.g., the topic or the number of sessions).

Similar to choosing an study name, do not include study specifics. 

>[!success] <i class="fa-regular fa-thumbs-up"></i> &nbsp Example: Good Abstract

# Initial Study Verification

When you finished the steps to select the study type and fill in the study information, **please contact us for an initial verification** at vbl@vu.nl.     

- If there are any study information we would like you to change, we will notify you.       
- When the necessary changes are incorporated, please email us, so that we can carry out the verification procedure again.     
- Once we give you a green light, you can continue with the next steps.     

>[!info] <i class="fa-solid fa-info"></i> &nbsp Checklist for All Studies
>- Checking the study on SONA in regards to selected study type among the types of studies, study name, brief abstract, and all the other items in "fill in the study information".  
>- Checking if you have incorporated [attention checks](attention-checks) in your survey. Even though this is not mandatory, we strongly advise you to do so, as the process of [granting or denying payment](granting-or-denying-payment) will be much easier for you.
>- Checking your **pre-screening** survey, if you have any.

>[!info] <i class="fa-solid fa-info"></i> &nbsp Additional Checklist Items for Physical Lab Studies
>- For any survey software (e.g., Qualtrics), the **blocking of the same IP address should be disabled**, as the same computers in our physical lab location will be used multiple times.

Please note that **if you are running a physical lab study, this initial verification will not lead to the [study launch](study-launch)**, and you will still have a couple of steps to complete after we give you a positive return.        



Here, provide the reference number that you have received from the Ethical Review Board. 

It is your own responsibility as a researcher to verify that your study complies with the ethical standard, by completing the [ethical checklist](https://vueconomics.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_1SKjMzceWRZIk9D). If the ethical checklist is not sufficient for your study, or you believe that your research should be approved by the **SBE Ethics Review Board (ERB)**, make sure to contact them and fill in the reference number. 

After you have completed the ethical checklist, you will receive a reference number formatted like `SBE3/29/2021djg590`. This is the code you will enter in SONA.

>[!warning]
>Even though we can give you an [[initial study verification]] and you can continue with some of the organizational steps, **we cannot make a [[study launch]] without an IRB approval code**.

# Overview on Conducting a Study through VBL

Setting up your study in the SONA Pool is easier than you think! Just follow the steps below, and in case your study has special requirements, contact [vbl@vu.nl](mailto:vbl@vu.nl).

<br>

### Step 0: Checks Before Starting the Process

For a smoother process:

1. Make sure you have your [ethical approval](ethical-approval).        
2. Know your [desired number of participants](desired-number-of-participants).      
3. Incorporate [attention check(s)](attention-checks) in your survey. This will ensure that you can [deny payment](granting-or-denying-payment) for non-serious participation.       
4. If you would like to have any prescreeners for your study, check out how to do it [here](prescreeners).      

<br>

### Step 1: Study Creation

1. Log in to [VBL SONA](https://vu-vbl.sona-systems.com){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} using your **VUnetID**		
2. [Create a New Study](create-a-new-study):		
    - [Select the Study Type](select-the-study-type)		
    - [Fill in the Study Information](fill-in-the-study-information)		

<br>

### Step 2: After Creating Your Study

(*divide this part into two seperate pages possibly*?)

After creating your study, **contact us** for [Initial Study Verification](initial-study-verification) at [vbl@vu.nl](mailto:vbl@vu.nl).

After we have verified your study details and have given you a green light,	if you have **an Online Study**, you can simply [Submit your Study for Final Approval](submission-for-final-approval), and wait for us to launch your study!

On the other hand, if you have **a Physical Lab Study**:	

1. First, we would like you to [Schedule a Pilot Testing](schedule-a-pilot-testing) with us			
2. After a successful pilot testing, [Pick Available Dates](pick-available-dates) for the Lab		
3. After selecting the dates for the lab, you can [create time slots](arranging-time-slots) for participants in SONA.			

<br>

### Step 3: The Data Collection

1. We will handle the [study launch](study-launch), and students will be notified about your study		
2. [Your Responsibility During Data Collection](responsibility-during-data-collection) 	
3. [Granting or Denying Payment](granting-or-denying-payment)		




After checking ..., we will contacting you regarding the reservation in the lab and the availability of the research assistants.
We will notify you regarding the availability of the lab and the research assistants.
Based on the availability, you can create/open timeslots for your study

- PhD will not get any research assistants, they will have to be present in the lab themselves
- due to the limited availability of RAs at VBL, there may be more waiting times
- If you have your own research assistant, please put them in contact with VBL, so we can advise them on the lab facilities, also grant them access (to their VU pass).
- access card if PhD or RA

[[Policy for Providing Lab Assistants]]

<iframe src="https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/VUBehavioralLab@bookings.vu.nl/bookings/" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto; height: 600px;"></iframe>


The marketing department has trained lab assistants to assist **faculty members of the marketing department** when collecting data in the physical lab. In order to plan your study well, make sure to contact the research administrators a month upfront. Time is needed to ensure that there are assistants available, that the study can be scheduled, and communicated to students. 

Does your study have specific instructions or requirements (e.g. virtual reality or products that need to be provided), contact the research administrators to connect you with a lab assistant.

**Are you a PhD. candidate?**
PhD. candidates are required to run their own studies in the SBE lab facilities and cannot ask for assistance of the lab assistants. Of course you are free to switch with fellow PhD. students to run specific time slots. We do strongly recommend that the division remains equal (e.g. you ask another PhD. student to run your lab study, please return the favor when the other PhD. student has a study in the lab). 

In case you yourself (e.g. research budget) or your supervisor is able to finance the assistance of lab assistants, an exemption could be provided by the research administration. 

**Are you from another department than marketing?**
We can share the manuals of the marketing lab assistants with you to facilitate you organizing your lab sessions.



In s


>[!question]
>Do you have **specific requirements for participation** in your research? If yes, also have them ready at hand, as VBL SONA System can help you set up [[Available Pre-screeners]]! 
>- E.g., "I want participants between ages 21 and 24"
>- E.g., "I only want students who have completed the course *Economics 2*."


# Available Pre-screeners

### Gender
...

### Year of Birth
...

### ...
...




As soon as the requested details have been approved by the research coordination, the study will be visible to students. Students will then start to enroll in their preferred time slots. 

Once **you or your lab assistants** are in the lab, make sure to check each student using the dashboard section of your study. Ask each student for their Sona ID before entering the lab and confirm whether the time slot matches the current time and date. If correct, click the plus sign to check the student into the lab.

**Critical:** Do not forget to check students in, no check-in means that the student cannot receive credits.

After the student is checked in, their participation is automatically approved. In cases of failed attention checks or unusual behaviour, you are able to withdraw your research credits in the system.


==--- online vs. physical==


If you have **a Physical Lab Study**, we strongly advise you to schedule a pilot testing before the [[study launch]]. This ensures that the study run smoothly in our physical lab location.

### Pick an Available Date Below for Pilot Testing!

# Select the Study Type

After selecting "Add New Study", you will have the option to pick from **two possible types of studies**:   

1. Standard Study   
2. Online External Study    

In a **"Standard Study"**, students will participate in **a single session** at our **physical lab location**, which is located on the second basement level (-2) of the [Transitorium Building](https://vu.nl/en/about-vu/more-about/transitorium){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

For more possibilities, see [types of studies](Types_of_Studies). 

Are you unsure about which type is the most fitting for your research? Reach out to us at vbl@vu.nl, and we can discuss it together with you!




# Study Name

A Study Name should be **short** and **general** (i.e., not containing highly-specific study information).

Additionally, when filling in the study name, also enter **the earliest date** you would like to launch the study before the title of your study. This practice ensures that every study has a unique title.

>[!success] <i class="fa-regular fa-thumbs-up"></i> &nbsp Example: Good Study Name!
><img src="/static/images/good_name.png" alt="Good Study Name" class="responsive-image">

><br>
>"Participate in this research and win a shopping basket of 100 euro!!!"
>
>- No date 
>- Unfair competition for other studies




Once this screen has been finished, you can complete your set-up by submitting the study to the research coordination. 

After submitting your study, please send an email to the research coordinator to communicate that your study is in the system and provide information about the requested days in the lab. ONLY AFTER letting the research coordination know about the days of requested dates, it will be officially blocked in the calendar for other researchers.

**Critical:** Do not forget to put the study to "Active" to send it to the coordination!



**Standard Study**: A study that is scheduled to take place at a specific time, in a specific place or over videoconference, and where there is only one part to the study that participants will participate in.

**Online External Study**: An online study located on another website like Qualtrics, SurveyMonkey, Gorilla, PsychoPy (Pavlovia), REDCap, or any other website.
